# Windows Icons

This [Modern UI Icons](http://modernuiicons.com/) project was started back in October 2011 with the goal of allowing developers a single solution for icons. Licensed under Creative Commons 3.0 the pack has grown very rapidly with hundreds of suggestions through Twitter.

My goal of moving the icons to github is to get more community involvement. I also really want to cover the icon needs for Windows 8 developers.

Thank you all so much for all the support and suggestions.

Currently there are hundreds of 76x76 icons provided in this pack (the legacy folder contains 48x48). If you are using the icons anywhere other than the application bar .xaml vector files are provided. Be sure to only use the white (aka dark) icons for the appbar.
